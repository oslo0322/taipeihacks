# Booking.bot
### Created by #9 Team Crescendo @Booking.com Taipei Hackathon 2017

**Booking.bot** is a personal chat-based assistant that increases booking efficiency, and enhances engagement level between Booking.com and customers.

### Problem

Customers spend so much time browsing through options and trying out filters. Also, search results in later pages usually do not get viewed much. These reasons result in increased search effort and longer decision process.

### Solution

Customers has been used to visit the Boking.com website to input initial requirements, such as, location and dates. However, instead of taking users to pages of hotel options directly, **Booking.bot** will suggest you with hotel option via a personalized messenger platform, and keep iterating based on the interaction with customer.
